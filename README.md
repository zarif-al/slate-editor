# Slate Editor Implementation

## Notes
- Had to set "downlevelIteration": true, in tsConfig in-order for typescript to be able to do type checking on Slate Types.
- Can only upload images from pexels.com as that is set as the only allowed domain in next.config.js
- All data is stored in localStorage for now
